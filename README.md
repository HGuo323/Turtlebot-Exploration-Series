# Turtlebot-Exploration-Series
Drive Turtlebot-burger around with ROS2! Different modes are included: pure following, orienting, and navigation.

-Orienting
Turtlebot-burger drives to three waypoints. It has to identify and avoid randomly placed obstacles on the way while heading to the goals. Once it reaches a waypoint, it will stop for 10 seconds before moving to next one.
